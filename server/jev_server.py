"""Jev Codex Router — local server on 127.0.0.1:4319 for the Codex Router.

Receives Responses requests destined for the "jev/auto" model (the Codex
Router's "jev" generic provider), asks Jev (TypeSafe System One) for a tier
and a thinking depth, applies the routing policy, then relays to the Codex
Router's local caller edge (native session sharing enabled) — with no format
conversion: Responses in, Responses out, SSE relayed verbatim.

Routing policy: Jev chooses one (model, thinking effort) pair for every call.
Every pair uses standard speed. Confidence is logged without changing the chosen
model. There are no keyword/scenario overrides or target model proportions.
Technical Jev failures remain fail-open to astra @medium and are logged separately.

Per-call awareness (v2): every request is classified as a fresh user turn, a
tool-step continuation, or other. Tool-steps carry a digest of the last tool
output and its tool name into the Jev state, so Jev routes THIS step
(mechanical continuation, standard next action, or frontier-worthy) instead
of re-judging the session's original prompt. On live sessions (7 days):
~92% of model calls are tool-steps — ~74% of the money weight.

Input handling (v3): Jev sees the current ask, never the thread — the task is
Codex's last user text, with Codex's own machine-generated envelopes stripped
(goal context, plugin catalog, environment, skills) and clipped to the
calibrated 500 chars as head+tail, because Codex appends the real tail after
its own blocks. Thread length never reaches the judge: extract() keeps one tail
item, the assistant side is bounded to 240 chars, and the only thread-sized
number (n_items) stays in the local log instead of the Jev state.
Live data (4 516 calls): 1 291 (29%) had sent Jev nothing but a
`<codex_internal_context source="goal">` block (~6.4k chars, p50) and 23 more
only a `<recommended_plugins>` catalog — the head-clip stopped inside the
envelope, so the user's actual request was never judged.

Fail-open: any Jev error → astra @medium. Kill switch: file
~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.off → relay astra without a decision.
Shadow: file ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.shadow → decide and log the
route, but serve plain astra (quality-neutral data collection).
Debug: file ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.debug → dump request shapes
(jev-router-debug.jsonl) and raw response streams (jev-router-debug-stream.log).
Display: streamed reasoning summaries get the routed tag appended in place
( · 🧠sol:low · ) so the Codex thread shows the picked model per call.
The same rewriter keeps one response id across a relayed stream: a tandem stream
has already crossed the local edge once, so its terminal event carries a
re-encrypted id, and the Responses consumer in front of us refuses a completion
whose id differs from the one `response.created` announced.
Non-stream callers (auto-compaction checkpoints, litellm non-stream path)
receive the SSE stream reassembled into a single JSON response object.
Balance: sufficient capability and effort for the next decision, including
compaction. Capability profiles are priors; outcome quality requires evaluation.
Log: ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl

Codex-dry tandem: when native usage is exhausted — a manual flag file
(~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.codex-dry) or an observed quota failure
(429 / usage-limit body) — the triptych is replaced until the window resets:
frontier-tier (astra) calls go to GLM (opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash), every
other tier to deepseek (opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash). A quota failure
flips the state and retries the same call on the tandem; a successful native
call clears an auto state (never the manual flag). A tandem call that comes
back retryable (429/5xx) is tried once on the sibling model, because the two Go
models are metered separately and a spent allowance is reported the same way a
transient outage is. The decided depth travels with the call, mapped onto the Go
ladder (low/high/max): a low step stays low, medium and high become high, and
xhigh or above become max.

    The last delta of each summary part is held back by one event so the tag can

    events, no sequence-number surgery, byte-exact pass-through everywhere else.

    A ``signature`` now means a leading route header on every assistant text
    message, including commentary and messages without a phase. The first text
    delta receives it immediately; done events and full items carry the same
    prefix. Tool arguments and reasoning content never receive this header.

    The same pass keeps a relayed stream's response id consistent. A Codex-dry
    call crosses the local edge, which encrypts response ids, so the terminal
    event of the stream we receive carries a freshly encoded id; the Responses
    transform in front of the router reads that as a completion that renamed
    itself and replaces the whole turn with an error event. The id announced by
    `response.created` is the one that travels, so a terminal event is rewritten
